Well, no program is perfect...

Generally
=========

Automatic adjustment to the NTSC standard 
(Here I must thank Peter Weiß, who installed the PAL-NTSC switch in my A2000).

Unfortunately, I was unable to rewrite playback routine 1 to the NTSC standard.
When attempting to play a piece of music in NTSC using playback routine 1,
the following error message appears: "Only in PAL" (Only in PAL mode).

Every now and then the entire program stopped at Karl-Heinz (TAR).
I suspect this is related to the messaging system.
The routines were completely changed.

Starting with Kickstart version 37.175, there were problems with the InputHandler.
This error has been fixed.

There were also problems with some monitors and ECS.
This error was corrected by using a second copper list.

When starting from an interlaced screen, the playback routine became 50% out of sync.
This error has been fixed.

Oktalyzer generally had problems starting if a different ScreenMode was set under >= 2.0.
Opening a screen also resolved these problems.

The CLI window now also pays some attention to the character set of the Workbench.

Finally, all known enforcer hits have been removed.

Pattern editor
==============

A different scrolling system was used here, which only shifts the entire screen in the top and bottom 8 lines.

Sample Editor
=============

The mouse pointer no longer appeared on newer Amigas after the sampler routine.
This was a bug in the keyboard input and has been fixed.

After using the sampler, it may happen that you cannot immediately return to the Octalyzer using Restart Octalyzer.
Here, you simply get around it by pressing a button.
I am currently still working on this problem.

Change Period did not work when the entire sample was selected (not in ALL mode).
This error has also been fixed.
Incidentally, this bug already occurred in the first version of Oktalyzer!

In Change-Period it is now possible to resample from note to note.
A new algorithm was also used here to prevent distortion of the sample.

Playback routine Octalyzer+Extern
=================================

The playback routine is now approximately twice as fast in 4-channel mode.

With the MIDI Out mode, Oktalyzer songs can now also be output via MIDI.
Here, samples 0-f are assigned to the corresponding MIDI channels.
The length of the MIDI notes is proportional to the Amiga sample lengths.
This is just a small 'hack' to enable the transfer of Oktalyzer songs to a MIDI sequencer.

External playback routine
=========================

In the case of multiple initialization, the music piece continued playing from the same pattern position.
This error has been fixed.

Music tracks that contained some blank samples in between were played incorrectly.
I was able to fix the error here as well.

For the "Seka® freaks", I have created two playback routines (AbsPlay1 and AbsPlay2) which can be placed at absolute addresses 
using the relocator program "Relox", which is located in the C directory.

After relocation using "Relox", the functions of the playback routines can be called as follows:

	jsr Basis+00	; OK_Init
	jsr Basis+06	; OK_Play
	jsr Basis+12	; OK_Stop
	jsr Basis+18	; OK_AllocDMA
	jsr Basis+24	; OK_FreeDMA
	jsr Basis+30	; OK_SetVol
	jsr Basis+36    ; OK_SetBalance

Where "Basis" is the starting address of the playback routine in the CHIP STORAGE.

As you may have already noticed, I have added new commands to the external playback routine.

The allocation routines OK_AllocDMA and OK_FreeDMA can be used, for example, to play your own samples while the music is playing.
Unfortunately, these routines only work with non-separated channels, 
as a desynchronization of the shared channels would have unpredictable consequences.


Name:       OK_AllocDMA

Handover:   d0: Channel (0-3) to be allocated.

Return:     d0:0.l : Error: Channel could not be allocated.
            d0:1.l : Everything OK.


Name:       OK_FreeDMA

Handover:   d0: Channel (0-3) to be released.

Return:     d0:0.l : Attention: Channel was already free.
            d0:1.l : Everything OK.

Warning: In the "OK_Init" routine, all channels are enabled.


Unfortunately, I forgot the SetVol routine in the first versions.
It is absolutely necessary to smoothly fade music in and out.


Name:       OK_SetVol

Handover:   d0: Master volume for all channels (0-$40)

Warning: If the specified volume is > $40, it will be ignored.
Warning: The internally stored value is not reset to $40 in the initialization routine "OK_Init".

The two stereo channels can also be controlled separately:

Name:       OK_SetBalance

Handover:   d0: Master volume on the left.
            d1: Master volume on the right.

The program Relox
=================

The Relox program was developed to assign finished Amiga programs to absolute addresses (for example, for EPROM programming).

The command is simply made by entering the keyword "RELOX" in the CLI.

After launching the program, you will first be asked for the source file name and the starting address.
Once Relox has analyzed and relocated the program, it will ask for the target filename.

Danger !!!  
Enter a track number here and Relox will save the program track by track directly to the floppy disk in drive 0.



Manual
======

Chapter 5 (File System) -------------------------------------------------

The following keyboard commands are also available in the file system:


ESC

To exit the file system requester (=CANCEL).


RETURN

Used to confirm the current file system requester (=OK).


"a"

Selects all files in the current directory if you are in multi-selection mode.


"c"

Deselects all files in multi-selection mode.


Chapter 15.2 (Installation) ---------------------------------------------

The source codes EXAMPLE1.s and EXAMPLE2.s are not used as examples for the calls
(the playback routines were not yet finished when the manual went to print).
